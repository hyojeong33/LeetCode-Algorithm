28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1

class Solution(object):
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        """
        :type haystack: str  # The string to search within
        :type needle: str    # The substring to find
        :rtype: int          # Returns the index of the first occurrence
        """

        # Python's built-in .find() method handles the core logic:
        # 1. It returns the index (starting from 0) if the needle is found.
        # 2. It returns -1 if the needle is not found in the haystack.
        # 3. If needle is an empty string, it typically returns 0.
        
        # This matches the LeetCode problem requirements perfectly.
        return haystack.find(needle)
